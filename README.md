# thinking-in-tensors

This repository serves as a chronicle of my academic and technical journey through the *Principles of AI* course at Krea University. It features two parallel streams of exploration:

- **Jupyter Notebooks** that follow the structure of the textbook *Understanding Deep Learning* — each notebook encapsulates key concepts, algorithmic intuition, and reflective implementation.
- **Lab Reports** that go beyond code, synthesizing theoretical understanding with experimentation, personal interpretation, and structured academic reporting.

## 🧾 Branching Structure

- `notebooks`: Implementation-first learning — self-written Jupyter Notebooks, arranged by chapter.
- `lab-reports`: Critical reflections and structured reports contextualizing the code and its implications.

## 🧠 Guiding Philosophy

> *“What I cannot create, I do not understand.”* — Richard Feynman

This repository is built on that ethos — writing code to internalize theory, and writing reports to consolidate understanding.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Perceptrons and Multilayer Networks  
- Backpropagation and Gradient Flows  
- Loss Functions and Optimization  
- Convolutional Architectures  
- Representation Learning and Transfer  
- Transformers and Large Language Models  
- Fine-Tuning and Prompt Engineering  

## 🧪 Work in Progress

As I continue to study and reflect, new chapters and lab reports will be added incrementally. Each commit message is crafted to capture the *essence* of what was learned or implemented.
